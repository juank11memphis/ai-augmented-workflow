# AGENTS.md

## Project overview

This repository is the home for establishing an AI-augmented development workflow. The exact shape is still being decided: it may become a CLI, a collection of shared skills and template files, or a combination of both. Generally, the goal is for someone to use this repository to set up their own AI-augmented development workflow on their local machine.

## Security and safety

- Do not commit secrets, credentials, tokens, or other sensitive data.
- Avoid destructive operations unless the user explicitly requests them or confirms the plan.
- Keep changes focused on the requested scope; do not introduce unrelated refactors or enhancements.
- If an implementation becomes materially more complex or risky than expected, stop and ask for explicit approval before continuing.

## Agent-specific instructions

- Before any task that requires code changes, propose a brief plan and wait for user confirmation once per requested task.
- After confirmation, proceed with all agreed in-scope changes without re-asking.
- Ask again only if the scope changes materially, the approach becomes materially more complex or risky, or the user explicitly asks to review before continuing.
- Use Conventional Commits 1.0.0 for commit messages.
